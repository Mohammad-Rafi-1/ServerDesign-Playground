Objective of this progam is to understand synchronous and Asynchronous operations- 
we gonna achieve this through by reading and writing the file sync and asycn in java-script


synchronous : instructions are executed one after another
              {

              instruction-1
              instruction-2
}

here instruction -2 needs to wait till instruction -1  get finish


Asynchronous : instruction does not need to wait for previous instruction to get executed 

in this case instruction -2 does not need to wait for instruction -1 

it only works when instruction are not cpu bounded
